Whenever you fail a roll and are rendered prone because of your failure, you immediately get up again, as if with [Rise from Prone](/combat/#rise-from-prone) (but always successful and not requiring an action).

You always know your exact distance to any place you've ever been before, and you automatically succeed on any relevant rolls to navigate to such a place (using any Ability).

You never unintentionally fall overboard from a ship.

Whenever you roll Sail, reroll each 6.

### Shipwreck-Surviving Stamina

**Cost** 4m; **Action** Dramatic (indefinite); **Duration** until the hazard has passed
