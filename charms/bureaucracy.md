### Creation of Adamant Specie

**Prerequisites** Bureaucracy 5, Essence 4, [Pattern-Exploiting Commerce Spirit](#pattern-exploiting-commerce-spirit)

**Keywords** Mute, Non-Committed Stackable (Esseence), Touch[^needs-touch]  
**Target** One coin made of a natural metal

You transform the target coin into a talisman (*Exalted*, p. 580) made of pure adamant, with its previous design replaced with Unconquered Sun's symbol on face and your chosen symbol on other. It has the following abilities:

- A bearer you have authorized may present the coin to ghosts, gods, raksha, or demons, who learn that the bearer is your agent and who learn your Resources rating. The bearer may arrange deals with such creatures based on your Resources, which is treated as an Eclipse-sanctified oath made by you (*Exalted*, p. 176) to pay these debts within a year and a day. If the other party in these deals becomes unable to complete the deal or intentionally makes it impossible for you to repay the debt, the oath is nullified. Demons will usually refuse such deals, even with the promise of the oath.

- A bearer you have authorized is immune to the deleterious effects of the Wyld (but not of specific Wyld creatures) while traveling through Wyld bordermarches.

- Each time a character would attempt to steal the coin, choose one randomly: if they succeed, as long as they carry the coin they replace each 9 and 10 in all rolls with 1; the character is treated as having a Defining Tie considering the coin to be cursed and better off left alone; the character treats moving the coin as a feat of strength with a Strength minimum one higher than their Strength.

- If in circulation without an authorized bearer, and you have Pattern-Exploiting Commerce Spirit ongoing, any character who comes into possession of the coin and fits your criteria for Pattern-Exploiting Commerce Spirit is affected as though by that Charm.

At any time, you may summon the coin back to yourself as a Reflexive Action. Over the next six hours, the coin finds itself back to you through various transactions and coincidental events.

To intentionally end the Duration, you must pay 1m. When the Duration ends, the coin transforms from adamant into lead.

When you use this Charm, an exotic package publicly arrives for you from a magical sender, such as a spirit, a Fair Folk court, or a group of ancestor ghosts. The package is obviously magical, exotic, and apparently valuable to all characters who see the public delivery. No one but you can open the package. Roll (Intelligence + Bureaucracy) with no other modifiers or Charms against difficulty 2. The number of threshold successes is the Resources value of the package's contents, which are otherwise random.

**Cost** 10m, 1wp; **Action** Dramatic; **Duration** One week

As part of the Action, you personally or impersonally give advice to members on organization. Roll (Charisma + Bureaucracy) against difficulty 5. If you succeed, the organization's controllers gain a pool of (Essence) order points and an order bonus of (extra successes)nd. They may spend an order point to gain the order bonus on a Bureaucracy, Investigation, Larceny, Lore, Medicine or War roll. Unspent order points and the order bonus are lost when the Duration ends.

You may replace the associated Intimacies with another activation of this Charm.
