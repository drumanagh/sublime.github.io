## Essence 1

### Wise Arrow[^no-uniform]

**Prerequisites** Archery 2, Essence 1  
**Cost** 1m; **Supplements** Archery attack; **Duration** instant

The supplemented attack treats the Defense of any character not under total cover as though it was 1 lower.

If the supplemented attack also benefits from an Aim action, it can strike a target in total cover, but only if there's some opening for an arrow to get through (even if it doesn't allow a direct path to the target). The target is treated as having +3 Defense against the attack.

### Sight Without Eyes

**Prerequisites** Archery 3, Essence 1, [Wise Arrow](#wise-arrow)  
**Cost**: 1m; **Supplements** Archery attack;[^supplemental-not-reflexive] **Duration** one tick

The supplemented attack ignores penalties for visual conditions, such as smoke, fog, and pitch darkness, but not for other conditions like high winds and cover.

**Unlock (Archery 5, Essence 3):** The supplemented attack also ignores cover less than total cover.[^whats-see-through-cover]

[^whats-see-through-cover]: The original text notes an ability to "see through cover", but doesn't supply a mechanical effect for it. This has been provided as a best-guess benefit.

### Blood Without Balance[^no-decisive]

**Prerequisites** Archery 4, Essence 1, [Sight Without Eyes](#sight-without-eyes)  
**Cost** 3m; **Action** Reflexive; **Duration** instant  
**Requirement** You benefit from a distract gambit, and your new Initiative is equal to the current tick or higher.[^whats-act-immediately]

[^whats-act-immediately]: The original text notes that this Charm triggers if the character could "act immediately", but characters with shifted Initiative don't act until the next tick. This has been added as a best-guess requirement.

Make a ranged decisive attack at up to long range. You don't need to Aim to make this attack. If you have under seven Initiative, the base damage of this attack gains (Essence) bonus dice.

### Force Without Fire[^no-withering]

**Prerequisites** Archery 4, Essence 1, [Sight Without Eyes](#sight-without-eyes)  
**Cost** 3m; **Supplements** withering Archery attack at up to short range; **Duration** instant

If the supplemented attack does at least as much damage as the target's Stamina:

* that Initiative is lost rather than transferred to you, and
* the target is knocked prone and back one zone, and
* the target loses any active benefit from a Rush.

### Trance of Unhesitating Speed[^no-decisive]

**Prerequisites** Archery 3, Essence 1, [Wise Arrow](#wise-arrow)  
**Cost** 4m, 1wp; **Action** Simple; **Duration** Instant  
**Requirement** You have at least 3 Initiative.

Make up to (Initiative รท 3, rounded down) decisive Archery attacks, with a maximum of (Dexterity) attacks. You don't need to Aim to make these attacks at medium or longer range. Your Initiative is divided up as evenly as possible between each attack. For example, if you have 11 Initiative and make 3 attacks, the attacks would be made with 4, 4, and 3 Initiative. Each 10 you rolls on one of these attack rolls increases the base damage of that attack by one. Your Initiative does not reset until you've completed every attack.

### Phantom Arrow Technique

**Prerequisites** Archery 3, Essence 1  
**Cost** 1m; **Supplements** Archery attack;[^supplemental-not-reflexive] **Duration** Instant

You can make the supplemented attack even if you don't have any ammunition for it. The phantom ammunition produced by this Charm last just long enough to deal damage (if any).

Once per scene when you use this Charm, you can choose an Intimacy and add +(Intimacy's strength) to the supplemented attack's attack roll. You can't use this function of the Charm again until you've spent significant effort in restoring, remembering, or being reminded of the reason for the Intimacy.

**Unlock (Essence 3):** Once per scene when you use this Charm, you can make the supplemented attack enduring. The real or phantom ammunition you use becomes permanent and indestructible, and if it hits can only be pulled from the target by you or someone you've granted permission, or by completely cutting away the material or flesh it's struck.

### Fiery Arrow Attack[^no-decisive]

**Prerequisites** Archery 4, Essence 1, [Phantom Arrow Technique](#phantom-arrow-technique)  
**Cost** 2m; **Supplements** decisive Archery attack; **Duration** Instant

If the supplemented attack deals at least three levels of damage, the attack's target catches on fire, and takes (your Essence) lethal dice of damage every turn until the fire is extinguished. If the target is made of flammable materials (such as a sail or bucket of oil), it catches on fire regardless of the damage dealt by the supplemented attack. This fire is natural, and may spread to surrounding objects or cause combustible materials to explode.

## Essence 2

### There Is No Wind[^no-dual]

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 2, [Sight Without Eyes](#sight-without-eyes)  
**Cost** 3m; **Supplements** Archery attack;[^supplemental-not-reflexive] **Duration** Instant

The supplemented attack ignores penalties from non-visual conditions, such as high winds, bad weather, flawed ammunition, and so on.

If the supplemented attack is withering, its accuracy is treated as if it were made from short range or the attack's actual range, whichever is shorter.[^tinw-at-short-range] This works at any range, including at extreme long range if you have appropriate Awareness Charms to target such an opponent.

[^tinw-at-short-range]: The original text doesn't clarify ranges closer than short range, but suggests the intent is for long-range use.

### Accuracy Without Distance

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 2, [Force Without Fire](#force-without-fire)  
**Cost** 1m, 1wp; **Action** Reflexive; **Duration** Instant

This Charm acts as an Aim action, except that it's a Reflexive action, it gives +3s as non-Charm successes instead of +3 to the following attack, and the benefits of this special Aim only apply to a decisive Archery attack.[^awd-best-guess]

[^awd-best-guess]: This is a best-guess interpretation of the original text's Decisive-only keyword.

**Upgrade (Essence 5):** You can apply the special Aim benefits to a withering attack against a crashed opponent, but only once during that crash period. The attack roll automatically succeeds.

### Arrow Storm Technique[^no-decisive]

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 2, [Trance of Unhesitating Speed](#trance-of-unhesitating-speed)  
**Cost** 5m, 1wp; **Action** Simple; **Duration** Instant

Make a decisive attack against one target.[^ast-no-attack]

[^ast-no-attack]: The original text doesn't actually tell you to make the initial attack. This has been added as a best-guess based on the 'extra' terminology used in the original text.

Then, choose up to (Essence ร 3) secondary targets within medium or closer range of your first target (even if these targets are outside of your weapon's normal range). Resolve a single decisive attack against all of the secondary targets at once, using a single attack roll applied to each target's Defense. Deal damage separately to each target, using a base damage of (Perception) and dividing your Initiative up as evenly as possible among them.

Your Initiative doesn't reset until you've completed every attack from this Charm.

### Flashing Vengeance Draw

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 2, [Trance of Unhesitating Speed](#trance-of-unhesitating-speed)  
**Cost** 3m; **Supplements** Join Battle roll; **Duration** Instant

The supplemented Join Battle roll gets +(Essence)s. In this combat, if you attack a target before they've acted, your first attack against them is unblockable.

You can't use this Charm to supplement a Join Battle roll that benefits from a Melee, Thrown, or Brawl Charm.

### Hunter's Swift Answer[^no-uniform]

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 2, [Flashing Vengeance Draw](#flashing-vengeance-draw)  
**Cost** 5m, 1wp; **Action** Reflexive; **Duration** Instant  
**Requirement** You succeed at a disengage action.

Make an Archery attack at close range, targeting a character you disengaged from.

### Immaculate Golden Bow

**Prerequisites** Archery 4, Essence 2, [Phantom Arrow Technique](#phantom-arrow-technique)
**Cost** 5m, 1wp; **Action** Simple; **Duration** One scene

You create a weapon with stats identical to a powerbow (see page 598 of *Exalted 3*). The weapon is made of solidified Essence forged in all the colors of Solar anima, and glows like a torch. You can pay 4m as a Reflexive action to make the bow grant you heavy cover against ranged attacks for 1 turn.

**Upgrade:** With each Upgrade, you add a custom Evocation to Immaculate Golden Bow. You should work with your GM to create Evocations that fit your character.

### Dazzling Flare Attack[^no-decisive]

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 2, [Fiery Arrow Attack](#fiery-arrow-attack)  
**Cost** 3m; **Action** Reflexive; **Duration** Instant  
**Requirement** A decisive Archery attack supplemented by Fiery Arrow Attack gets at least one 10 on the attack roll.

Add +1s to the triggering attack roll. For each 10 in the attack roll, add +1 to the attack's raw damage.

This Charm's effect is bright enough to be seen for miles. Every concealed character[^shadow-for-cover] within two range bands (including yourself) must roll Stealth, with a -2 success penalty to the attempt, or be revealed.

[^shadow-for-cover]: The original text notes characters โusing shadow for coverโ. This has been rephrased for mechanical clarity, as distinct from actual cover.

## Essence 3

### Seven Omens Shot[^no-decisive]

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 3, [Accuracy Without Distance](#accuracy-without-distance)  
**Cost** 3m, 1wp; **Action** Simple; **Duration** Instant  
**Requirement** You've used Aim against a single target each round for the previous three rounds.

Make a decisive Archery attack against the target of the triggering Aim actions. You get +3s as non-Charm successes instead of +3 from the Aim, and you add any threshold successes from the attack roll to the attack's raw damage.

Each use of Accuracy Without Distance before using this Charm, instead of granting that Charm's normal benefit, reduces the rounds needed to Aim for this charm by one and reduces this Charm's special Aim bonus by 1s.

If you kill an opponent with an attack generated by this Charm, you gain 1wp.

### Revolving Bow Discipline[^no-withering]

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 3, [Arrow Storm Technique](#arrow-storm-technique)  
**Cost** 6m, 1wp; **Action** Simple; **Duration** Instant  
**Keywords** Perilous

Choose a non-crashed target at short or closer range. Make a withering Archery attack against that target and repeat until you miss, crash the target, or deplete the target's Magnitude (if it's a battle group)

**Unlock (Essence 4):** If you crash a target with an attack generated by this charm, you gain 1wp.

### Finishing Snipe[^no-decisive]

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 3, [Hunter's Swift Answer](#hunters-swift-answer)  
**Cost** 7m; **Action** Reflexive; **Duration** Instant  
**Requirement** A target within range of your Archery weapon suffers crash, and you're not engaged in a Simple action that would prevent you from attacking.

Make a decisive Archery attack against the triggering target. You don't need to Aim to make this attack.

### Rain of Feathered Death[^no-decisive]

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 3, [Phantom Arrow Technique](#phantom-arrow-technique)  
**Cost** (3 ร X)m, 1wp; **Action** Simple; **Duration** Instant

Make a decisive Archery attack. If the attack hits, it deals damage (X + 1) or (Dexterity) times, whichever is less. For each damage roll past the first, the raw damage is (Initiative - previous damage roll's successes) or (Essence), whichever is more.

### Shadow-Seeking Arrow[^no-uniform]

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 3, [Dazzling Flare Attack](#dazzling-flare-attack)  
**Cost** 3m, 2i; **Action** Reflexive; **Duration** Instant  
**Requirement** Your Awareness reveals a hidden target or targets.

Make an Archery attack against one of the revealed targets. You don't have to Aim for this attack. You can use this Charm multiple times in regards to the same trigger, but only with different targets.

### Searing Sunfire Interdiction[^no-decisive]

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 3, [Dazzling Flare Attack](#dazzling-flare-attack)  
**Cost** 4m, 1i, 1wp; **Action** Simple; **Duration** Instant

Against a target you didn't use this Charm against as your last Simple action,[^whats-twice-consecutively] make a decisive gambit Archery attack with difficulty 3. Double each 9 on the damage roll. The attack doesn't require Aim. If the attack succeeds, the target's next turn is delayed by (2 + extra successes on the gambit's damage roll) ticks, but he keeps the same Initiative. If this would delay the target's turn to tick 0 or later, he loses his turn for the round.

[^whats-twice-consecutively]: The original text requires it not be used โtwice consecutivelyโ. This is added as a best-guess mechanical interpretation.

If you use Aim, on the next round you may activate this Charm and act first in the round, using the Charm as your Simple action and taking your turn out out of the normal turn order (but keeping your normal Initiative). If another character uses magic to act first on the same round, the character with the higher Initiative acts first.

The Upgrades for this Charm must be purchased in order.

**Upgrade (Essence 3):** The gambit is difficulty 2. If the attack succeeds, you don't lose Initiative.

**Upgrade (Essence 4):** If you drop an opponent from a higher Initiative tick to a lower Initiative tick than yours, reset your attack.

**Upgrade (Essence 5):** You can use this Charm against a target you used this Charm against last round. If you do, ignore the wp cost. If you succeeded with the last use and succeed with this use of the Charm, the target is pushed backwards one zone, even if this would force him off a cliff or a rooftop.

**Upgrade (Essence 6):** Each time you successfully hit with this Charm's attack, unless you force the target to lose their turn with the attack, you can use this Charm again against the same target without needing an action. Ignore the wp cost for each use past the first. For every two successful attacks against the same target with this Charm, the target is pushed back one zone. If you force the target to lose their turn, you gain 1wp.

**Upgrade (Essence 6):** If you force the target to lose their turn, you can use this Charm against a new target without needing an action.

### Solar Spike[^no-decisive]

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 3, [Dazzling Flare Attack](#dazzling-flare-attack)  
**Cost** 5m, 1wp; **Action** Simple (1/scene); **Duration** Instant

Make a decisive Archery attack against a target with lower Initiative than you. The attack ignores your weapon's range, can be made from medium or long range without Aim, and can be made from extreme range with Aim. Instead of your Initiative, the attack has a raw damage of your current temporary Willpower. If you're trying to uphold or protect an intimacy, multiply this raw damage by the Intimacy's intensity. The attack doesn't reset your Initiative if it succeeds.

You can't use this Charm with [Fiery Arrow Attack](#fiery-arrow-attack) or [Rain of Feathered Death](#rain-of-feathered-death).

**Reset:** Successfully make a withering attack and get a 10 six times across the attack and damage rolls.

### Heart-Eating Incineration[^no-decisive]

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 3, [Solar Spike](#solar-spike)  
**Cost** 3m, 3a; **Supplements** Solar Spike;[^supplemental-not-reflexive] **Duration** Instant  
**Requirement** Your anima is at bonfire.

Add your Initiative to the raw damage of the supplemented use of Solar Spike. Your Initiative is reset if the attack succeeds.

If you kill a target with the supplemented use of Solar Spike, the target's body and soul are burned away completely, and you gain (highest intensity of any Intimacy for the target + Essence)m. If the target is a spirit, it can still reform normally.

Using this Charm resets your anima to the dim level.

## Essence 4

### Dust and Ash Sleight[^no-decisive]

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 4, [Seven Omens Shot](#seven-omens-shot)  
**Cost** 3m; **Supplements** Seven Omens Shot;[^supplemental-not-reflexive] **Duration** Instant

The supplemented use of Seven Omens Shot takes one fewer Aim action, but doesn't get the Aim bonus to the attack roll.

**Upgrade (Essence 5):** You get the Aim bonus to the attack roll.

### Heavens Crash Down[^no-withering]

**Prerequisites** Archery 5, Essence 4, [Revolving Bow Discipline](#revolving-bow-discipline)  
**Cost** 6m, 2i, 1wp; **Action** Reflexive; **Duration** Instant  
**Keywords** Clash, Perilous  
**Requirement** You are attacked from short or closer range, and you are in your -4 health levels.

Make a withering Archery attack against the triggering attacker. Add +(Essence)s to the attack roll and double each 9 on the damage roll. If you would gain Initiative from the attack's damage, instead roll that much decisive damage against the target, ignoring hardness and doubling each 10. Resolve your attack and the attack against you as a clash.

**Upgrade (Essence 5):** Remove the Perilous keyword. You can spend Initiative on this Charm even while crashed, reducing your Initiative into the negatives.

### Streaming Arrow Stance
