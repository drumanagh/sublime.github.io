# Contributing

Pull requests are great.

1. Fork, then clone the repo:

   git clone git@github.com:your-username/lost-egg.github.io.git

2. Make your changes. For simple changes, this probably means just modifying a Markdown file. For more complicated changes, you'll want to have Ruby installed, so you can run `bundle install` and `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the repo folder to view a copy of the site locally.

3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
