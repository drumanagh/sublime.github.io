## Craft

**Craft projects** come in four categories: basic, major, superior, and legendary.

| Category  | Examples                                                         |
|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Basic     | Simple furniture, tools                                          |
| Major     | Weapons and armor, works of art, part of a ship, room of a manse |
| Superior  | Castles, warships, daiklaves, Artifact 3--5, Manse 3 or 5        |
| Legendary | Flying warships, Artifact N/A, Manse N/A                         |

**Crafting experience** represents inspiration and effort used in crafting, and comes in three types: silver (sxp), gold (gxp), and white (wxp). Usually, sxp is spent on major projects, gxp is spent on superior projects, and wxp is spent on legendary projects.

Most projects use **project slots**, which represent the attention and resources that a crafter can devote to projects. Basic projects use no project slots, but other projects each use 1 project slot of the matching category (major, superior, legendary). You start with 3 permanent major project slots, and no other project slots. You can create temporary project slots by satisfying the cost and requirements shown in the table. They last for the duration of the project that uses them.

| Temporary slot | Project           |        Cost | Other requirements                        |
|:---------------|:------------------|------------:|:------------------------------------------|
| Major          | ---               |        5sxp | ---                                       |
| Superior       | Engineering       |        2gxp | You also use 2 major project slots        |
| Superior       | Artifact or Manse | (rating)gxp | You also use (rating) major project slots |
| Legendary      | Artifact or Manse |        5wxp | ---                                       |

The minimum time needed to work on a project, and the Ability requirements and other requirements for a project, depend on the project's category, the type of project, and the Artifact or Manse rating (if any) of the project. The physically larger the project, the more manpower you'll need to work on it, but you still make all the rolls yourself as long as you're in charge.

| Category  | Project      | Minimum time     | Abilities                                                    | Materials |
|:----------|:-------------|:-----------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|:----------|
| Basic     | ---          | Minutes or hours | Craft 1                                                      | Cheap     |
| Major     | ---          | Hours or days    | Craft 1                                                      | Standard  |
| Superior  | Engineering  | ST-determined    | Craft 4                                                      | Standard  |
| Superior  | Artifact 2   | 6 weeks          | Craft 4, Craft (Artifacts) 1, Lore 3, Occult 3               | Exotic    |
| Superior  | Artifact 3   | 3 months         | Craft 4, Craft (Artifacts) 1, Lore 3, Occult 3               | Exotic    |
| Superior  | Artifact 4   | 1 year           | Craft 4, Craft (Artifacts) 1, Lore 3, Occult 3               | Exotic    |
| Superior  | Artifact 5   | 2 year           | Craft 4, Craft (Artifacts) 1, Lore 3, Occult 3               | Exotic    |
| Superior  | Manse 3      | 1 year           | Craft (Architecture) 4, Craft (Geomancy) 1, Lore 3, Occult 3 | Exotic    |
| Superior  | Manse 5      | 2 years          | Craft (Architecture) 4, Craft (Geomancy) 1, Lore 3, Occult 3 | Exotic    |
| Legendary | Artifact N/A | 10 years         | Craft 5, Craft (Artifacts) 5, Lore 5, Occult 5               | Exotic    |
| Legendary | Manse N/A    | 10 years         | Craft (Architecture) 5, Craft (Geomancy) 5, Lore 5, Occult 5 | Exotic    |

Once you've worked on the project for the minimum time, you can attempt to complete it. The roll to complete an Artifact always uses the lower of the appropriate Craft or Craft (Artifacts), and the roll to complete a Manse always uses the lower of Craft (Architecture) or Craft (Geomancy).

Completing a basic project requires a successful (Attribute + Craft) roll against a difficulty set by the ST.

Completing a major project works like completing a basic project, except if you fail the roll, you can add a few more hours of work and spend 10sxp to roll again.

Completing a superior project requires a successful (Attribute + Craft) extended roll, with difficulty 5, terminus 6, and a goal of 30 for an engineering project or Artifact 2, 50 for Artifact 3 or Manse 3, 75 for Artifact 4, and 100 for Artifact 5 or Manse 5. If the superior project is to repair an Artifact or Manse rather than create a new one, or the superior project is an engineering project, the extended roll has no terminus. Instead of having an interval, you pay 10gxp each time you want to make a roll for the extended roll. If you botch on any roll, or if you fail the extended roll, all costs spent on the project are wasted and you can never attempt to build exactly the same Artifact again.

Completing a legendary project works like completing a superior project, except that the goal is 200 and you pay 10wxp for each roll for the extended roll.

### Rewards

If you successfully complete a project, you get a **reward** if the project satisfies one or more of the **basic objectives** for crafting projects:

* The project causes another character to gain or strengthen an Intimacy toward you.
* The project results in a clear gain for you, whether in physical resources, social connections, or other benefits.
* The project resonates with one of your Intimacies.

The reward you get depends on the type of project.

| Category  | Project                   | Reward                                                                               |
|:----------|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Basic     | ---                       | 2sxp per basic objective satisfied, +1sxp for exceptional success                    |
| Major     | ---                       | 2gxp and 1sxp per basic objective satisfied, +1gxp for exceptional success           |
| Superior  | Artifact 2 or engineering | 3wxp + (4 × [terminus - intervals used])gxp                                          |
|           | Artifact 3 or Manse 3     | 5wxp + (6 × [terminus - intervals used])gxp                                          |
|           | Artifact 4                | 7wxp + (8 × [terminus - intervals used])gxp                                          |
|           | Artifact 5 or Manse 5     | 9wxp + (10 × [terminus - intervals used])gxp                                         |
| Legendary | Artifact N/A or Manse N/A | 10wxp + (successes on a full Craft excellency roll)gxp + (other dice on the roll)sxp |

If the project was to repair something rather than build something new, you get a smaller reward.

| Category  | Project                   | Reward                             |
|:----------|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| Basic     | ---                       | 1sxp per basic objective satisfied |
| Major     | ---                       | 1gxp per basic objective satisfied |
| Superior  | Artifact 2 or engineering | 1wxp                               |
|           | Artifact 3 or Manse 3     | 2wxp                               |
|           | Artifact 4                | 3wxp                               |
|           | Artifact 5 or Manse 5     | 4wxp                               |
| Legendary | Artifact N/A or Manse N/A | ---                                |

If you successfully complete one or more projects, you also get a second reward at the end of the story. You get (number of Craft Abilities at 3+ used in the story to complete a project × 3)sxp, (number of Craft Abilities at 5+ used in the story to complete a project × 5)sxp, and (number of Artifacts or Manses created in the story × 5)gxp.

### First Age Wonders

A project that's a **First Age wonder** is a special case. These projects work like other projects, except:

* You must use Craft (First Age Artifice). To buy any dots in this Ability, you must have Lore 5, Occult 5, Craft (Artifacts) 5, and Terrestrial Circle Sorcery.
* You pay wxp for each roll on the extended roll.
* Each roll on the extended roll requires a sorcerous working first to magically prepare the components or to create impossible magical components.

| Category  | Project                 | Sorcerous Workings                                                    |
|:----------|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Superior  | Artifact 2--3, Manse 3  | Terrestrial Circle workings                                           |
| Superior  | Artifact 4--5, Manse 5  | Terrestrial Circle workings and at least one Celestial Circle working |
| Legendary | Artifact N/A, Manse N/A | Celestial Circle workings and at least one Solar Circle working       |

## Investigation

### Case Scene

**Defense** ---  
**Action** Dramatic (15 minutes); **Duration** Instant

Choose one:

* Roll (Perception + Investigation) against a difficulty set by the ST or by [Conceal Evidence](#conceal-evidence). If you succeed, you find anything of interest that's been hidden.
* At a location relevant to something you're looking for, roll (Perception + Investigation) against a difficulty set by the ST. If you succeed, you find a clue that advances your search.

### Profile Character

**Defense** ---  
**Action** Dramatic (5 minutes); **Duration** Instant

## Larceny

### Conceal Evidence

**Defense** ---  
**Action** Dramatic (15 minutes); **Duration** Instant

Choose evidence to conceal and roll (Intelligence + Larceny). The result becomes the difficulty of [Case Scene](#case-scene) to find the concealed evidence.

Choose a disguise to construct and roll (Intelligence + Larceny). You get a cumulative -2 on this roll for differences in sex, race, or body type. If you're imitating a specific person, you get -(4 - weeks spend studying that person) on this roll.

Characters who interact with you for more than five minutes can roll (Perception + Awareness) at a difficulty of your initial Disguise roll result to notice that you're in disguise and get a sense of what you really look like.

If you're imitating a specific person, a character observing you knows that person, and you act inappropriately for the role, that character can make an additional roll to see through the disguise, at +1 to +3 depending on how drastically you mis-acted.

### Lockpicking

### Navigation

**Defense** ---
**Action** Dramatic; **Duration** Instant

Navigating through or past a hazard requires (Wits + Sail) rolls, with a difficulty depending on the danger of the hazard and a number of rolls depending on the scale of the hazard. If you fail, the ship is blown off-course, is caught in the hazard, or takes 1 Hull damage.

| Example                     | Difficulty | Number of rolls |
|:----------------------------|:----------:|:----------------|
| Hearty gale, overnight      |     1      | 5 rolls         |
